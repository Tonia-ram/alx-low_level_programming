C - Function pointers

Learning Objectives:
- What are function pointers and how to use them
- What does a function pointer exactly hold
- Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory

Requirements
- Used editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All files end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Code uses the Betty style. Checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- Used global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden
- You are allowed to use _putchar
- You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
- In the provided examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. Used to test the functions.
- The prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function _putchar is included in the header file called function_pointers.h
- Pushed header file
- All your files are include guarded
