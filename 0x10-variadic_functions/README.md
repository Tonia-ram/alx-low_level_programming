C - Variadic functions

Learning Objectives:

- What are variadic functions
- How to use va_start, va_arg and va_end macros
- Why and how to use the const type qualifier

Requirements:

- Used editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All files end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Code uses the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- Global variables are not permitted
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden
- Used the following macros: va_start, va_arg and va_end
- You are allowed to use _putchar
- You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
- In the examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. Used them to test the functions.
- The prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function _putchar is included in the header file called variadic_functions.h
- All header files are include guarded
