## C - Singly linked lists

#Learning Objectives:
- When and why using linked lists vs arrays
- How to build and use linked lists

#Requirements:

- Used editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All files end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is present
- This code uses the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- Global variables are not permitted
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden
- using _putchar is allowed
- You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
- In the examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called lists.h
- The header file was pushed
- All header files are include guarded

#Tasks:
0. Wrote a function that prints all the elements of a list_t list.
1. Wrote a function that returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list.
2. Wrote a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t list.
3. Wrote a function that adds a new node at the end of a list_t list.
4. Wrote a function that frees a list_t list.
5. Wrote a function that prints You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\nI bore my house upon my back!\n before the main function is executed.
6. Wrote a 64-bit program in assembly that prints Hello, Holberton, followed by a new line.
